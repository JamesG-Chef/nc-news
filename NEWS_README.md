# NC. News App
## Project summary

- A mobile first, responsive Front-end app built using ReactJS.
- NC news is an article based app, populated with an assortment of articles written by a number of users.
- The app interacts with my own API accessing data from a postgreSQL database.
- The articles can be sorted by a combination of topics (which are populated dynamically dependant on the database), comments, votes and date.
- A logged in user is able to upvote an article and leave a comment.
